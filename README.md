# Roboweek Challenge

> This repository contains a snippet (Motion_Algorithm.cpp) provided by the Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG), Brazil. In the aforementioned code snippet, there is a rough Kinematic Motion Algorithm developed by [me](https://github.com/camponogaraviera) (UFSM, NTNU) and my colleague [Guilherme Christmann](https://github.com/guichristmann) (UFSM, NTNU) for the purpose of a 24h robotics competition held in Brazil, 2018.

# Instructions
To reproduce the simulation access [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rIWDC9wHPcT_eNRiRx-XcyBCDKqV4Xsh) for instructions with Gazebo simulator.

Below is our TurtleBot completing the entire circuit and leading position in the second to last race. Our implementation was the only one that actually completed the entire labyrinth, but in the finals, our TurtleBot collided with the other consequently overturning, and eventually, we got second place according to the distance criteria from the finish line.
