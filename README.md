# Roboweek Challenge

> This repository contains a rough Kinematic Algorithm developed by me (UFSM, NTNU) and my colleague [Guilherme Christmann](https://github.com/guichristmann) (UFSM, NTNU) for the purpose of a 24h robotics competition held in Brazil in 2018.

Challenge: development of an algorithm for driving a TurtleBot inside a maze environment with the aid of laser sensors. 

# Award

Second place medal awarded to overall individual team winner of a 24h robotics competition (RoboWeek) at the Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG), Brazil.

# Instructions
To reproduce the simulation, kindly access [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rIWDC9wHPcT_eNRiRx-XcyBCDKqV4Xsh) for instructions on how to operate the Gazebo simulator.

Below is our TurtleBot completing the entire circuit and leading position in the second to last race. Our implementation was able to complete the entire labyrinth. However, in the finals, our bot slammed into another, consequently overturning, and so we got second place overall according to the distance criteria from the finish line.
