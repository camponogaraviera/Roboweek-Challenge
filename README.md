# Roboweek Challenge

> This repository contains a snippet (Motion_Algorithm.cpp) provided by the Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG), Brazil. In the aforementioned snippet, there is a rough Kinematic Algorithm developed by [me](https://github.com/camponogaraviera) (UFSM, NTNU) and my colleague [Guilherme Christmann](https://github.com/guichristmann) (UFSM, NTNU) for the purpose of a 24h robotics competition held in Brazil in 2018.

Challenge: development of an algorithm to drive a TurtleBot inside a maze environment with the aid of laser sensors. 

# Award

Second place medal awarded to overall individual team winner of a 24h robotics competition (RoboWeek) at the Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG), Brazil.

# Instructions
To reproduce the simulation kindly access [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rIWDC9wHPcT_eNRiRx-XcyBCDKqV4Xsh) for instructions with Gazebo simulator.

Below is our TurtleBot completing the entire circuit and leading position in the second to last race. Our implementation was able to complete the entire labyrinth, however, in the finals, our TurtleBot collided with another, consequently overturning and, eventually, we got second place overall according to the distance criteria from the finish line.
